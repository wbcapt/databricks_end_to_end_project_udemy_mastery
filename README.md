This repo was utilized for the Udemy Project: 
https://www.udemy.com/course/azure-databricks-end-to-end-project-with-unity-catalog-cicd/learn/lecture/41604494#overview

I had originally set up two databricks workspaces:
1) databricks my_free_trial_databricks which is was used for the theory sections of this project AND other udemy 
    As of July 2024 this did not incur a cost. I shut it down
    It is a dormant workspace, but showcases basic examples of important architecture
2) endtoend_dev which was intended to be a dedicated databricks workspace for just the project portion of the course, ie section 7 onwards
    As of Nov 2024 this is still incurring a cost
    It demonstrates unity catalog

The directories are as follows in github:
1) Original_Project_Code : this is the original project code for the project lectures
2) project_working_directory: this is my markup of the project code
3) Theory Sections My Markup: This is my markup of the theory sections (prior to section 7)
4) Unaltered course files: these are all the unaltered files from the instructor's repo both theory and project
